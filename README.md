This is my personal Spring Boot starter project, set up with:

Spring Boot 3.5.3 for the latest stable framework features

Java 21 compatibility to leverage the newest Java language improvements

A clean Maven setup with essential dependencies:

spring-boot-starter-web for building web applications and REST APIs

spring-boot-starter-test for robust testing support

Configured Maven Compiler Plugin targeting Java 21 bytecode

Spring Boot Maven Plugin for easy build and run commands

This blank template helps me quickly bootstrap any new Spring Boot backend application with modern Java, ensuring a smooth development experience.
